                Doing part of your studies abroad means opening up to new cultures, being curious and daring, knowing
                how to overcome a form of the unknown. In a globalized world in which the future engineer will evolve,
                this is an irreplaceable experience. ESPRIT has forged partnership links with foreign higher education
                establishments allowing students in their studies to pursue specific options within the partner
                establishment (double course or double degree). This opportunity is exclusively open to the best Esprit
                students who combine excellent academic background, good communication skills in English and French and
                a keen sense of responsibility: indeed the sustainability of these agreements also depends largely on
                the seriousness of attendance and success of ESPRIT students. For the year 2016/2017, 71 students are in
                training abroad, in France or in the United States. Among them, 11 benefit from a scholarship. This
                number of constant year-over-year growth represents approximately 10% of a promotion.

                The international aspect can intervene in the course even of the students of Esprit thanks to the
                mobility and the international experience:

                For a semester of study in one of the partner universities and an internship, which replaces the 5th
                year at Esprit, the student then obtains the Esprit engineering degree.
                For 2 full years: the student obtains two diplomas jointly: the Esprit diploma and the Master's degree
                from the foreign partner institution.

                During the 4th year, students are notified by email of the selection procedures. Departure to a partner
                university can only be done through the school's procedure. Financial aid can be obtained which will
                help the student to complete his project.
